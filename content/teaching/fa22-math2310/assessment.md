### Homework

There will be weekly homework assignments due on Tuesday night. The weekly homework will involve:

- online exercise ([Cengage - Webassign](https://www.webassign.net/)),
- written homework assignments to be turned in through [Gradescope](https://collab.its.virginia.edu/portal/site/919a961a-6bab-40d8-9d89-a51d89d52296/page/f40b44f1-c9a0-4f3e-9f80-c85157254942),

Throughout the semester there will be several periodic additional projects:

- group video presentations

Consistent effort on homework is vital to the success in the course and the homework assessment represents a significant portion of the final grade. Use this to your advantage: we welcome discussion and questions about homework assignments during office hours and on Piazza. Homework deadlines should be respected, however small extensions may be considered in case of necessity.

You are **encouraged** to study and work together with your peers on HW assignments. Explaining your though process and figuring things out together often helps with understanding and mastering the material. Everyone should turn in their own copy, unless specified otherwise. You **MUST** acknowledge any collaboration and external sources used.

Failure to acknowledge help or external references constitutes an *Academic integrity violation*.  If you forget to acknowledge sources of help, please do so as soon as you remember.

### Examination

The course will have 2 proctored midterm exams (90 minutes) and 1 final exam. The midterms will occur outside standard class time, in the evening (starting at 18:30). The dates will be published shortly after the beginning of the course.  In case of conflicts, you must reach out as soon as possible and no less than 7 working days before the scheduled midterm. Missing a midterm will result in a grade of 0 for that assignment. No makeup opportunities will be allowed if not agreed upon beforehand.

The midterms and final are *open book*. You are allowed to use the course book, published course material (e.g. HW solutions), and any personal notes you have taken when studying. No other external material is allowed. Please prepare in a timely manner

More details will be provided closer to the examination dates

### Grades

Your final grade will be computed according to the following proportions (subject to minor modification).

| Grade composition (subject to change) |     |                                               |
| ------------------------------------- | --- | --------------------------------------------- |

| Homework-Handin                       | 25% | (worst 2 homework grades dropped)             |
| Midterm 01                            | 10% |                                               |
| Midterm 02                            | 10% |                                               |
| Final                                 | 15% |                                               |
| Other                                 | 15% | recorded presentations and other assignments. |

Several times during the course you will receive information about approximate letter grade cutoffs. These are subject to modification and provided only for your information. The final grade cutoffs are established at the end of the course.
