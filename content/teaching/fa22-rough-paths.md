## Summary

Martin Hairer received the Fields medal at the ICM in Seoul 2014 for “his outstanding contributions to the theory of stochastic partial differential equations" (quoted from the ICM webpage), in particular for the creation of the theory of regularity structures[^1]. The theory of regularity structures formally subsumes Terry Lyons' theory of rough paths[^2] [^3] and is particularly adapted to solving stochastic parabolic equations[^4]. A more analytic generalization of rough paths has been developed by Gubinelli et. al. in the form of paracontrolled calculus[^5] and has proven applicable to stochastic PDE with dispersive behavior[^6]. 

The goal of this reading seminar is to gain an understanding of the relation of the results panorama of singular stochastic PDEs with particular attention to the results above. We will mainly concentrate on the classic Terry Lyons' theory and its subsequent development in terms of paracontrolled calculus. In particular, we will follow lecture notes by Gubinelli[^8] and the intro book[^9] by Hairer and Friz. This starts mainly with ODE theory. We will then try to progress to SPDEs (parabolic) by following[^10]. Finally, it might be interesting to present how these ideas are applied to dispersive PDE[^7] [^11] and also to compare paracontrolled theory with Hairer's regularity structures[^9] [^1].

Gennady has previously partially followed a course and taught on closely related topics so he would gladly provide lectures in the beginning. Initiative to present topics further down the road is appreciated but not required. 

### Prerequisites

- A solid background in Lebesgue integration theory and classical analysis.
- Exposure to probability and stochastic analysis is suggested.

We plan on developing pathwise stochastic integration in this context but a certain general familiarity with the Brownian motion and Ito's formula is suggested.

- Basics of Fourier analysis is required:
  + $L^2$ theory
  + theory of distributions
  + generalized functions and Sobolev spaces (will be reviewed quickly)

- Exposure to basic PDEs (heat, wave) is encouraged (especially starting from the second part of the seminar).




### Additional material

In the meantime, to get an informal introduction of the relation of rough path theory to applications outside of math please enjoy the following talk:

Other interesting material (that will probably not be covered in the seminar):

- [Rough Path Theory and Signatures Applied To Quantitative Finance - Part 1 | QuantStart](https://www.quantstart.com/articles/rough-path-theory-and-signatures-applied-to-quantitative-finance-part-1/)

We are open to suggestions on closely related topics.
