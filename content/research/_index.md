My research is concerned with Harmonic Analysis and the theory of singular integral operators. My main area of work is time-frequency analysis, initiated by Carleson with his celebrated result on the pointwise convergence of Fourier series for  functions. Since then the field has been significantly developed and many deep and surprising connections have been found with Ergodic Theory, Additive Combinatorics, and, crucially, with the study of dispersive PDEs and SDEs. On the other hand, many fundamental questions in the area remain open and some are beyond the reach of currently developed techniques. Time-frequency behavior often arises when considering maximal or multilinear analogues of Calder√≥n-Zygmund SIOs.

My PhD thesis (2016) was concerned with developing and applying outer measure Lebesgue space theory: a powerful and general functional-analytic framework allowing one to systematically deal with with a large class of time-frequency operators.

## Banach space-valued harmonic analysis
Most results about singular integral operators were originally formulated for functions valued in . Many PDE applications however require analogous results for functions valued in Banach spaces. I am in particular interested in extending time-frequency analysis results to the context of Banach spaces. Studying multi-linear operators valued in Banach spaces can also provide interesting insights about the intrinsic geometry of different Banach spaces on their own and when related to others (multi-linear Banach space geometry).

## Uniform bounds
Many multilinear operators in harmonic analysis, known as "Brascamp-Lieb" operators, depend on several geometric parameters. Many operators in time-frequency analysis happen to be singular variants of such "Brascamp-Lieb" inequalities. While many bounds are known in specific cases, a more uniform theory is incomplete. Trying to prove "uniform bounds" for such operators i.e. bounds that are independent of a specific geometric parameter configuration elucidates how time-frequency techniques interact with more classical harmonic analysis results.

## Outer Lebesgue spaces
Outer Lebesgue spaces have found great use in formalizing, cleaning up, and streamlining quite complex, and sometimes ad-hoc, arguments in time frequency analysis proof by providing a consistent functional analytic framework. Many abstract questions (duality, interpolation etc.) about outer Lebesgue spaces remain open.

## Stochastic PDEs: renormalization and paracontrolled calculus
Evolution PDEs with random driving noise or random initial data present new challenges. Parabolic equations have been investigated at length using both analytic and algebraic techniques; my main interest is related to dispersive equations. Techniques recently developed for dealing with stochastic dispersive PDEs seem to have interesting potential applications even in deterministic settings in time-frequency analysis e.g. understanding bounds for the Nonlinear Fourier Transform (aka scattering transform).
