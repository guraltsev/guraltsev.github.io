My research is in Harmonic Analysis and the theory of singular integral operators. My main area of work is time-scale-frequency analysis, initiated by Carleson with his celebrated result on the pointwise convergence of Fourier series for $L^2$ functions. Since then the field has been significantly developed and many deep and surprising connections have been found with Ergodic Theory, Additive Combinatorics, dispersive PDEs and SDEs etc.. Time-scale-frequency behavior arises when considering maximal or multilinear analogues of Calder√≥n-Zygmund SIOs.

My PhD thesis (2016) developed and applied outer measure Lebesgue space theory: a powerful and general functional-analytic framework allowing one to systematically deal with with a large class of time-frequency operators by factoring them through embedding maps. Embedding maps associate to functions a set of coefficients indexed by the symmetry group of the operator at hand. 

# Banach space-valued harmonic analysis

Most results about singular integral operators were originally formulated for functions valued in . Many PDE applications however require analogous results for functions valued in Banach spaces. I am in particular interested in extending time-frequency analysis results to the context of Banach spaces. Studying multi-linear operators valued in Banach spaces can also provide interesting insights about the intrinsic geometry of different Banach spaces on their own and when related to others (multi-linear Banach space geometry).

# Uniform bounds

Many multilinear operators in harmonic analysis, known as "Brascamp-Lieb" operators, depend on several geometric parameters. Many operators in time-frequency analysis happen to be singular variants of such "Brascamp-Lieb" inequalities. While many bounds are known in specific cases, a more uniform theory is incomplete. Trying to prove "uniform bounds" for such operators i.e. bounds that are independent of a specific geometric parameter configuration elucidates how time-frequency techniques interact with more classical harmonic analysis results.

# Outer Lebesgue spaces
Outer Lebesgue spaces have found great use in formalizing, cleaning up, and streamlining quite complex, and sometimes ad-hoc, arguments in time frequency analysis proof by providing a consistent functional analytic framework. Many abstract questions (duality, interpolation etc.) about outer Lebesgue spaces remain open.

# Stochastic PDEs: renormalization and paracontrolled calculus

Evolution PDEs with random driving noise or random initial data present new challenges. Parabolic equations have been investigated at length using both analytic and algebraic techniques; my main interest is related to dispersive equations. Techniques recently developed for dealing with stochastic dispersive PDEs seem to have interesting potential applications even in deterministic settings in time-frequency analysis e.g. understanding bounds for the Nonlinear Fourier Transform (aka scattering transform).
